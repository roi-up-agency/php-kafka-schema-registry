partition.assignment.strategy            |  C  |                 | range,roundrobin | medium     | Name of partition assignment strategy to use when elected group leader assigns partitions to group members. <br>*Type: string*
session.timeout.ms                       |  C  | 1 .. 3600000    |         10000 | high       | Client group session and failure detection timeout. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats (heartbeat.interval.ms) to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no hearts are received by the broker for a group member within the session timeout, the broker will remove the consumer from the group and trigger a rebalance. The allowed range is configured with the **broker** configuration properties `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`. Also see `max.poll.interval.ms`. <br>*Type: integer*
heartbeat.interval.ms                    |  C  | 1 .. 3600000    |          3000 | low        | Group session keepalive heartbeat interval. <br>*Type: integer*

coordinator.query.interval.ms            |  C  | 1 .. 3600000    |        600000 | low        | How often to query for the current client group coordinator. If the currently assigned coordinator is down the configured query interval will be divided by ten to more quickly recover in case of coordinator reassignment. <br>*Type: integer*
max.poll.interval.ms                     |  C  | 1 .. 86400000   |        300000 | high       | Maximum allowed time between calls to consume messages (e.g., rd_kafka_consumer_poll()) for high-level consumers. If this interval is exceeded the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another consumer group member. Warning: Offset commits may be not possible at this point. Note: It is recommended to set `enable.auto.offset.store=false` for long-time processing applications and then explicitly store offsets (using offsets_store()) *after* message processing, to make sure offsets are not auto-committed prior to processing has finished. The interval is checked two times per second. See KIP-62 for more information. <br>*Type: integer*
enable.auto.commit                       |  C  | true, false     |          true | high       | Automatically and periodically commit offsets in the background. Note: setting this to false does not prevent the consumer from fetching previously committed start offsets. To circumvent this behaviour set specific start offsets per partition in the call to assign(). <br>*Type: boolean*
auto.commit.interval.ms                  |  C  | 0 .. 86400000   |          5000 | medium     | The frequency in milliseconds that the consumer offsets are committed (written) to offset storage. (0 = disable). This setting is used by the high-level consumer. <br>*Type: integer*
enable.auto.offset.store                 |  C  | true, false     |          true | high       | Automatically store offset of last message provided to application. The offset store is an in-memory store of the next offset to (auto-)commit for each partition. <br>*Type: boolean*
queued.min.messages                      |  C  | 1 .. 10000000   |        100000 | medium     | Minimum number of messages per topic+partition librdkafka tries to maintain in the local consumer queue. <br>*Type: integer*
queued.max.messages.kbytes               |  C  | 1 .. 2097151    |       1048576 | medium     | Maximum number of kilobytes per topic+partition in the local consumer queue. This value may be overshot by fetch.message.max.bytes. This property has higher priority than queued.min.messages. <br>*Type: integer*
fetch.wait.max.ms                        |  C  | 0 .. 300000     |           100 | low        | Maximum time the broker may wait to fill the response with fetch.min.bytes. <br>*Type: integer*

If the client encounters a message larger than this value it will gradually try to increase it until the entire message can be fetched. <br>*Type: integer*
max.partition.fetch.bytes                |  C  | 1 .. 1000000000 |       1048576 | medium     | Alias for `fetch.message.max.bytes`: Initial maximum number of bytes per topic+partition to request when fetching messages from the broker. If the client encounters a message larger than this value it will gradually try to increase it until the entire message can be fetched. <br>*Type: integer*
fetch.max.bytes                          |  C  | 0 .. 2147483135 |      52428800 | medium     | Maximum amount of data the broker shall return for a Fetch request. Messages are fetched in batches by the consumer and if the first message batch in the first non-empty partition of the Fetch request is larger than this value, then the message batch will still be returned to ensure the consumer can make progress. The maximum message batch size accepted by the broker is defined via `message.max.bytes` (broker config) or `max.message.bytes` (broker topic config). `fetch.max.bytes` is automatically adjusted upwards to be at least `message.max.bytes` (consumer config). <br>*Type: integer*
fetch.min.bytes                          |  C  | 1 .. 100000000  |             1 | low        | Minimum number of bytes the broker responds with. If fetch.wait.max.ms expires the accumulated data will be sent to the client regardless of this setting. <br>*Type: integer*
